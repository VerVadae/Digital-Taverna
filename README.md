Sample Site for Digital Taverna

## Craig Notes
Hello,

- If you're installing this onto a coding platfomr, i'd recommend running the following command into the terminal `` npm install``
- This helps to create the packages i installed to make development server and testing run more smoothly than the Git deploy method. Otherwise, ignore the server.js and package files.
- If you do install the packages, you can run a dev server on your local pc bu ussing the following command in your terminal `` npm run dev``

Cheers,
Craig
